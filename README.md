# omy_leader_isaaclab

Use a **ROBOTIS OMY-L100 leader arm** to teleoperate robots in **NVIDIA Isaac Lab** — in joint
space, no IK, from a single pip-installable repo.

| target | mapping | env |
|---|---|---|
| **OMY-F3M** (ROBOTIS Lab / [cyclo_lab](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/robotis_lab)) | 1:1 joint mirror (same kinematics) | `Cyclo-Lift-Cube-OMY-Leader-v0`, `Cyclo-Pick-Place-Bottle-OMY-Leader-v0` |
| **Franka Panda** (Isaac Lab stack task) | arm 1:1 with J3 locked, wrist remapped (fixed per-joint map, optional exact ZYZ solve) | `Isaac-Stack-Cube-Franka-JointTeleop-v0` (+ `-Cam-v0` with cameras) |

The leader is exposed as an Isaac Lab **teleop device** (`OmyLeaderCfg` / `OmyLeaderDevice`) registered
in the official `create_teleop_device` factory, so scripts that build their device from
`env_cfg.teleop_devices` — e.g. cyclo_lab's `record_demos.py` — use it with `--teleop_device omy_leader`
and no code changes.

Why joint space: an end-effector teleop through differential IK lags, drifts and cannot control the
redundant joint; a leader arm gives you every joint directly.

## Install

On the machine running Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab (tested: Isaac Sim 5.1.0 with Isaac Lab v2.3.0 + robotis_lab,
and with Isaac Lab `main`):

```bash
# inside your Isaac Lab python environment
pip install git+https://github.com/charlie8612/omy_leader_isaaclab
```

Dependencies are only `numpy` and `dynamixel-sdk` (the L100 is read directly over Protocol 2.0, 4 Mbps).
Optional: `[lerobot]` to read the leader through [`lerobot_teleoperator_omy`](https://github.com/charlie8612/lerobot_teleoperator_omy)
instead, `[viewer]` for the laptop video viewer.

For the OMY targets install ROBOTIS Lab as well and add the 3-line hook from `scripts/cyclo_lab_hook.patch`
to `cyclo_lab/__init__.py` (this is what a `record_demos.py` invocation needs to see the device and envs).

## Quick start (leader plugged into the sim machine)

```bash
export ISAACLAB=~/IsaacLab
scripts/run_teleop.sh --target omy    --auto-zero             # OMY in cyclo_lab, with a display
scripts/run_teleop.sh --target franka --auto-zero --headless --stream   # Franka, video on port 5556
```

`--auto-zero`: when the stream comes up, hold the leader in the target's default pose (what you see on
screen) for 3 s; per-joint zeros are computed. Add `--port /dev/ttyUSB0` if your udev name differs.

Record demos with cyclo_lab's own script (device settings come from env vars, no new flags):

```bash
OMY_LEADER_SOURCE=serial OMY_LEADER_AUTO_ZERO=1 \
python scripts/imitation_learning/isaaclab_recorder/record_demos.py \
    --task Cyclo-Pick-Place-Bottle-OMY-Leader-v0 --teleop_device omy_leader --dataset_file datasets/omy.hdf5
```

## Advanced: leader on a different machine / sim on a headless server

The common setup is one PC with Isaac Sim and the L100 on USB — everything above is that. If your sim
runs on a headless server elsewhere:

```
[L100 host]  omy-leader-publisher --port /dev/robotis_left         # 72-byte TCP frames, 100 Hz
             ssh -N -R 5555:localhost:5555 <sim host>               # or relay through the laptop
[sim host]   scripts/run_teleop.sh --target franka --source tcp --headless --stream
[laptop]     SIM_HOST=<sim> L100_HOST=<l100 host> scripts/laptop_connect.sh   # tunnels + viewer window
```

The video is the sim's own camera rendered to JPEG over TCP (30 fps, a few ms over a LAN), which works
through plain ssh where Isaac's WebRTC livestream (UDP) cannot.

## Calibration

`--auto-zero` is usually enough. For a persistent calibration (signs, zeros, gripper endpoints, wrist mode):

```bash
omy-leader-calib                      # lerobot-style: sweep every joint to its limits, then hold the ready pose
omy-leader-monitor --calib omy_calib.json   # live raw angles + mapped Franka joints
scripts/run_teleop.sh --target franka --calib omy_calib.json
```

`examples/omy_calib_franka.json` is a real calibration of one L100 (signs j2/j4/j6 inverted relative to
the URDF axes; wrist mode `direct`, reset with the hand in line with the forearm). Flip a joint's
`omy_sign` if it moves the wrong way in the sim.

### Franka wrist mapping

The L100 is UR-like (yaw–pitch–pitch, then pitch–roll–spin) and the Franka with J3 = 0 is
yaw–pitch–pitch, roll–pitch–roll. Around the operator's working pose the joints correspond one to one,
so the default `direct` mode uses

```
J1 = j1   J2 = j2   J3 = 0   J4 = j3        J5 = j5   J6 = 180° − j4   J7 = 45° − j6
```

(with per-joint sign/zero from calibration). `wrist_mode: zyz` instead matches the tool orientation
exactly via a closed-form ZYZ decomposition (`franka_wrist.py`), at the cost of J5/J7 coupling near the
Franka wrist singularity (J6 = 0 or 180°).

## Layout

```
omy_leader_isaaclab/
  device.py           OmyLeaderCfg(target="omy"|"franka", source="serial"|"tcp") + OmyLeaderDevice(DeviceBase)
  omy_serial.py       DynamixelSDK reader (arm torque-off extended position, spring-loaded gripper trigger)
  link.py             TCP leader stream (publisher.py <-> device)
  mirror.py           L100 -> OMY 1:1 (sign / zero / rate limit / gripper hysteresis / auto-zero)
  franka_config.py    Franka mapping config, joint limits, calibration loader
  franka_retarget.py  L100 -> Franka 8-d action (J3 locked, wrist direct or ZYZ)
  franka_wrist.py     wrist geometry: direct map and closed-form ZYZ solve
  franka_calib.py     lerobot-style calibration -> omy_calib.json;  franka_monitor.py: live readout
  omy_env_cfg.py      cyclo_lab OMY tasks with absolute JointPositionAction + teleop_devices
  franka_env_cfg.py   Isaac Lab Franka stack task, same treatment (+ camera variant)
  teleop.py           standalone runner (--target, --source, --stream)
  publisher.py / fake_publisher.py / video.py / viewer.py
scripts/              run_teleop.sh, laptop_connect.sh, cyclo_lab_hook.patch
tests/                pure-numpy tests of both mappings (pytest)
```

## Status

- Franka target: driven with a real L100 (Isaac Lab `main`, Isaac Sim 5.1.0).
- OMY target: verified end to end with a simulated leader in cyclo_lab; the DynamixelSDK reader has
  been exercised only through the lerobot path so far — please open an issue if your L100 misbehaves.
- cyclo_lab's `record_demos.py` imports `omni.ui`, so it needs a display (not `--headless`).
